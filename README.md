# cHarris-Portfolio
Portfolio for Christopher Harris

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The purpose of this challenge was to develop a portfolio to showcase the skills we learned in weeks 1 & 2 related to HTML and CSS using the mockup. I went one step further and setup the design I wireframed in Miro and incorporated the requested functionality in the *Applications* section of the homepage.

Please note, there is commented out code in both the index.html and style.css documents. The intent here is to replicate a portfolio I drew inspiration from, both in design and functionality, but with slight modifications based on my preference for design. 

### USER STORY
**AS AN** employer **I WANT** to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples **SO THAT** I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### ACCESSIBILITY CRITERIA
**GIVEN** I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
**THEN** I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections  about them, their work, and how to contact them ✅ 
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
**THEN** the UI scrolls to the corresponding section ✅ 
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
**THEN** the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications ✅ 
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
**THEN** that application's image should be larger in size than the others ✅ 
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
-- **THEN** I am taken to that deployed application ✅ 
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
**THEN** I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport ✅ 

## USAGE
The site is currently in progress, so please note that not everything may work at this time. Areas that still need to be built (as of 4/27/2023) include:

- Hamburger menu
- Form submit to my personal email address (at least until I can setup a local database)
- Adjust section heights and @media queries to better account for mobile clean-up
- CSS code consolidation to improve performance
- Case Study page build
- Update scrolling functionality to compensate for view height
